    I have been working as a Software Engineer on properitary quantitative trading infrastructure for
    2.5 years. My primary professional devleopment consists of .NET desktop applications and distributed systems
    using C# and SQL, though I also work with C++ libraries and Python scripting. Beyond
    work, I pursue many low-level and high-performance projects in the realm of scientific
    simulation and rendering. There are no bounds to the technologies I want to explore, but I
    am especially drawn toward parallel computing and systems programming. Recently I have been
    writing a lot of Rust.

    Since I was a young child I have been fascinated with computers (especially videogames).
    In highschool I taught myself Java to program Minecraft mods, and learned to hack Mario Kart Wii
    with memory injections. Sorry to any of my victims from those online lobbies. I grew up in the
    suburbs of Chicago, and received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
    University of Illinois Chicago.

  My hobbies include lots of extraneous development and scientific learning. I love physics, biology and AI.
  I still make some time for videogames like Overwatch and Hearthstone. Recently I have been very into biking,
  but Chicago winter is rolling in so I'll probably go back to indoor bouldering.
